# Autocomplete
In this project, the goal is to create an autocomplete functionality that adapts based on user input. The system maintains a
dictionary of words with associated priorities and dynamically updates as new words are added or recent words are used. It
categorizes user input into new words and existing words with lower priority, enhancing user experience and productivity
